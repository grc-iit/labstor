LabStor Client Init:
1. LabStor Client connects to LabStor Server
2. LabStor Server sends registers client
3. LabStor Server sends client the following:
    - Userspace SHMEM
        - 1MB for QPs
        - 16MB for latency-sensitive I/O
        - Can request up to 512MB of memory
    - Runtime memory (for sharing namespace)
4. LabStor Client responds with the SHMEM

Memory Allocation
    1. There are three types of memory: shared and DMA
    2. Shared memory is used only for communicating with LabRuntime.
    3. DMA is used for I/O. Can be communicated with LabRuntime.
        - DMA may be the same as SHMEM
    4. Kernel is used for communication with the kernel.

ipc_manager_->Malloc(LABSTOR_SHMEM, pid)
ipc_manager_->Malloc(LABSTOR_DMA, pid)
ipc_manager_->Malloc(LABSTOR_KERNEL, pid)

ipc_manager_->GetQueuePair(this, rq, LABSTOR_QP_ORDERED, pid)
ipc_manager_->GetQueuePair(this, rq, LABSTOR_QP_UNORDERED, pid)


Userspace processes always communicate with root LabStor Runtime

LabMods may be assigned to different runtimes.

PROCESS A:
    QP: Shared between PA and PB
    QP.Enqueue(rq, modA)

PROCESS B:
    QP: Shared between PB
